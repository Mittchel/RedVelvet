Sources for the demo shown at the presentation named "*Turn specs into high quality apps*" . It's about combining the power of [Specflow](http://specflow.org/) and [Xamarin.UITest](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/) to deliver apps in a ATDD/BDD way.

Sample app based on [Todo from Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/master/Todo). Simply package the .Droid solution to get an *.apk file which can be tested by the .Test solution.
